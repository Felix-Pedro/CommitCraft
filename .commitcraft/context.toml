CommitCraft is an innovative tool designed to enhance the quality of your Git commit messages by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI). 
It automatically generates summaries and commit messages based on the changes introduced in a pull request or commit, making it easier for developers to communicate what's been updated in their code.
The project aims to streamline the development process by providing AI-driven suggestions that are tailored to specific contexts and features added or modified within the repository.
